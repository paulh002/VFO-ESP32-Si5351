# VFO-ESP32-Si5351 v2.33
Updated network functions. Added telnet support for debugging, CAT interface on port 1003 support.
CAT interface will send frequency updates when the VFO is tuned. This is used by RF-AMP and later Antenna tunner to follow the frequencies
See PWRSWR repository for the rf-amp esp32 controler with swr meter functionality. I use same VFO PCB also for rf-amp controler. 

# VFO-ESP32-Si5351 v2.32
Updated the ota software to support Arduino IDE interface, recently I have dropped the Arduino IDE for Visual Studio 2019 which gives a bit more software development support
The main changes for this version is a Network CAT support the idea is from TRXNET (TRX-Manager) unfortunally TRX-Manager is discontinued. But the idea of a CAT interface on tcp/ip is nice. I use this interface to let the VFO to communicate with other ESP32 controlers to automatic send commands to my rf-amp. Also I want to use it to communicate with my automatic antenna tuner. Will be added to github later.

# VFO-ESP32-Si5351 v2.31
Some PCB updates, added output capacitors and changed the resistor pi network on the output to simple voltage divider.
The pi network caused a higher current in the buffer transistor which causes the board to radiate some BFO frequency.
This was picked up by my IF and caused the AGC to react. It seems to be better to lower the current in the buffer transistor.
The output voltage can be regulated by adjusting the resitor divider.

# VFO-ESP32-Si5351 v2.3
I added a new version of the pcb to support Wifi and uses a buck converter for powersupply.
I am still testing if the buck converter does not generate to much noise.
Source code is adjusted to use new GPIO ports so ADC1 is only used

# VFO-ESP32-Si5351 v2.2
Now my transceiver is in a box, it is more easy to update software using wifi. This release support this. The only problem is that some analog ports will not support both ADC and wifi, in the next release I will update the PCB and rearange the analog inputs to user ADC1 only.

# VFO-ESP32-Si5351 v2.1
The PCB has a connector for analog I/O this is intended to support facilities like SWR meter, Voltage and current meter. In the src directory I have put a version of the software that support SWR measurement and CAT interface. Also some simple calibration menu's are added. But this is still in development. The code for SWR comes from Loftur E. JÃ³nasson - TF3LJ / VE2LJX but was intended for Teensy. I made a ESP32 implementation of it and with support for ILI9341 adafruit library. 
I will update (hope fully) this extension the comming months to have full calibration capability for both si5351 and the AD8307 log detectors. A pcb for the SWR meter is also developed this I will put in a seperate repository.

# VFO-ESP32-Si5351 v2.0
The new version v 2.0 uses 2x si5351 on the pcb with buffer transistors to minimize crosstalk. The old version had about 52 db  crosstalk suppression with the new version this is much improved. I cannot hear any injected spurs any more. But will add some measurements later.
The SI5351 library is updated to support multiple si5351's.

If you are using diode double balanced mixers than a square wave is no problem. But if you want to use a jfet balanced mixer than you need to filter the output of the vfo. For this I developed a filter PCB which is controled by the vfo.

VFO build in into QRP tranceiver with hycas IF and bandpassfilters managed by esp32
The VFO uses a optical encoder for frequency adjustment and mechanical rotary for bandswitch and option selection.
